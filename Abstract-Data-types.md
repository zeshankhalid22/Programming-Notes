### Abstract Data Types
int, float, double, long etc are build in data types used for perfoming basic arithmetic operations.
Suppose we need to define our own user-defined Operations for our own user-defined data type.for this purpose
we can create our own user-defined data structures along with their operations whatever we like, those type of 
data structures  are called Abstract Data type (ADT).
The process of providing only essentials and hiding details is known as abstraction. e.g when we press car accelator
the car's speed increases but we don't know how it works behind. this is called abstraction.
